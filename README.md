# SLR-206: Distributed algorithms
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course SLR-206 at Télécom Paris

Students who complete this module (organized in two modules of 24h each) will learn how to design distributed algorithms, reason about their correctness, and derive matching complexity bounds. The primary focus of the module is on understanding of the foundations of distributed computing. The first  module will discuss basics of synchronization, fault-tolerant shared-memory computations, consensus and transactional memory.
